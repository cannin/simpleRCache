Title: Simple R Cache
Description: A package to do simple result caching in R based on Henrik Bengtsson's R.cache. 
  The global environment is not considered when caching results simplifying moving files between
  multiple instances of R. Relies on more base functions than R.cache (e.g. cached results are 
  saved using saveRDS/readRDS).
