Title: Simple R Cache
Description: Simple result caching in R based on Henrik
    Bengtsson's R.cache. The global environment is not considered when caching
    results simplifying moving files between multiple instances of R. Relies on
    more base functions than R.cache (e.g. cached results are saved using saveRDS() 
    and readRDS()).
